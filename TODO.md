# TODO

## Bugs

* data_binding replacements can be chains, not just single codes

## False positives

* Parse `[Concept('A', 'B')|E]` in localization
* parse `local_template` in gui files
* parse `layer` in gui files
* Parse and validate #tooltip: directives in localization

## Features

* If a datafunction is not found, but it does exist with a case-insensitive search, offer that version as an info hint
* The validations in IDEAS.md
* Hundreds of TODO comments in the code
