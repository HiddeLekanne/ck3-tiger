# Example adapted from KeizerHarm.
# This shouldn't warn about scope:child because lists should be checked
# with loose scope checking. The list is also used by an event which does
# set scope:child, which shouldn't cause a warning either.
# In mod2 there is a check that it DOES cause a warning if the event doesn't
# set scope:child.
